    <h2>My top 5 Movies of all time</h2> <hr>
    <h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3> <img src="" alt="">
    <p>It is the movie I'd say you watch if you can watch one movie in your entire life. It is the most inspiring movie of all time and by watching this movie I've learnt about patience and determination. I highly recommend this movie to watch atleast once in thier lifetime. </p>
    <h3>The Shining</h3>
    <p>If you say you are a horror movie fan and you haven't watched this movie then I'll say you don't know anything about horror. After watching this movie I realise this deserves to be called  a horror movie not those who just rely on jumpscares and I thought I have't watched a horror movie before in my Life.</p>
    <h3>A Silent Voice</h3>
    <p>I don't know why & how this movie became my top favourite anime movie ever. I think It's this movie soundtrack and it's two main character. I was in tears while watching this movie and I just thought how did this movie became my favourite of all anime movie.</p>
    <h3>3 Idiots</h3>
    <p>This movie is very close to my heart. I am watching this movie again & again and this movie still touches my heart last time let alone I don't remember when I first watched this movie. According to me this the greatest bollywood movie of all time and I am very sure about that. Very funny, very inspiring and most of all veryheart touching.</p>
    <h3>Oldboy</h3>
    <p>Oh god, This the movie, like the movie, the best plot, the greatest twist, the mindbender , great action, This is the movie I thought of when I say abolute height of art, very dark & beautiful. you can't miss this movie but only when you are above 18 years of age</p>
